      <h3>Firearm Safety & Training</h3>
      <p>
        1. Treat every firearm as if it is loaded - Always assume a gun is loaded, even if you believe it isn't. 2. Never point the muzzle at anything you are not willing to destroy - Always keep the gun pointed in a safe direction, away from people and animals. 3. Keep your finger off the trigger until you are ready to shoot - Keep your finger outside the trigger guard when not actively engaging a target. 4. Be sure of your target and what is beyond it - Identify your target clearly and make sure there is nothing behind it that could be accidentally hit. 5. Store firearms securely - When not in use, ensure firearms are stored in a safe, secure location, out of reach of unauthorized persons. 6. Know how to properly operate your firearm - Familiarize yourself with the firearm's controls and ensure you understand how it works. 7. Use the correct ammunition - Always use the ammunition specified by the manufacturer for your firearm. 8. Wear proper safety gear - Always wear eye and ear protection when shooting.
